1.  Make sure everything is installed in requirements.txt

2.  Run python manage.py migrate

3.  Log in with a user account that actually has a real email

4.  Set a reminder for like 1 minute in advance so you don't have to wait forever

5.  *In another terminal* Run python manage.py runapscheduler before the reminder time approaches (you can run python manage.py runapscheduler right after you runserver also if you want)

6. When you are done, close out of all terminals
